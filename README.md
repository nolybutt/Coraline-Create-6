Coraline's Create 6

Welcome to Coraline's Create 6! This modpack began as a special project I created for my daughter, Coraline, and me to explore, build, and have adventures in together. We wanted a world filled with incredible engineering marvels, exciting challenges, and beautiful places to discover. Now, we're inviting you to join the fun!

This pack is built for creative minds who love problem-solving and for brave adventurers who aren't afraid of the dark. Itâ€™s all about creativity, teamwork, and having a great time.

Key Features

    Build an Industrial Empire: At its heart, this pack is a massive expansion of the Create mod. With over 20 hand-picked add-ons, you can design sprawling, automated factories, revolutionize logistics with advanced trains and transport systems, and build contraptions you've only dreamed of. The possibilities are nearly endless.

    Defend Your Creations: Your industrial progress will not go unnoticed. The nights are filled with new dangers. Hyper-aware zombies from Zombie Awareness and nightly hordes from UndeadNights will test your defenses, while terrifying creatures from Anomaly and The Root of Fear lurk in the darkness. You'll need to gear up with a modern arsenal of firearms and tactical equipment to protect your shared home.

    Explore a Vast, New World: Journey through a world reborn. Discover dozens of breathtaking new biomes from Oh The Biomes We've Gone, cross grand new chasms with YUNG's Bridges, and uncover hidden communities with Stoneholm, Underground Village. There's always something new to find over the next hill.

    A Smooth & Beautiful Adventure: A great adventure shouldn't be laggy. The pack is built on a powerful performance foundation, featuring Embeddium (a high-performance Sodium fork), Oculus (for full shader support), and a suite of other optimization mods to ensure your gameplay is as smooth as possible, even with large factories.

Installation

To play this modpack, it is highly recommended to use a modern Minecraft launcher that can import modpacks directly.

Recommended Method (Using Prism Launcher)

    Download and install Prism Launcher.

    In the main window, click "Add Instance" in the top-left.

    Prism will automatically set up the instance. Once it's done, right-click the new instance and select "Edit".

    Go to the "Settings" tab and adjust the "Memory" allocation. It is recommended to allocate at least 6 GB (6144 MB) and ideally 8 GB (8192 MB) of RAM.

Manual Method (Advanced)

This method is not recommended as it can overwrite your existing launcher settings. Please back up your .minecraft folder first.

    Download and install Minecraft Forge for version [Your Minecraft Version, e.g., 1.19.2]. Make sure you have run it at least once.

    Download this repository as a .zip file and extract it.

Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to my daughter, Coraline, for being the inspiration for this project and the best co-op partner a dad could ask for.

And of course, this pack would be nothing without the incredible work of all the mod authors who share their creativity with the Minecraft community. Please support them!

Happy building!
